#We are going to loop through an unordered array, comparing the elements in it to each other, and ordering them from lowest to highest.


#Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
  #No

#What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
  #The program will have an array as the only input.

#Whatâ€™s the desired output?
  #The desired output is the same array that is inputted, but the elements are in order from smallest to greatest.

#Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
  #We want to take the array we are provided
  #Compare the element at index 0 to the element at index 1
  #If the element at index 0 has a higher value that the element at index 1, then swap the indices of the two elements.
  #then compare the elements at index 1 and index 2.
  #repeat this for every element in the array
  #Once you reach the end of the array, loop back to the start and compare elements 0 and 1 again.
  #Loop through once for every element in the array minus one.
